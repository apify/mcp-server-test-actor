## Apify MCP Server Test Actors

This repository contains two Apify Actors used for testing the [Apify MCP server](https://mcp.apify.com/) integration. Each Actor lives in its own subdirectory and is built and deployed independently.

## Actors

- [`mcp-server-actor/`](./mcp-server-actor) — Runs as an MCP server via [Apify Standby](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running/standby), exposing the MCP endpoint at `POST /mcp`.
- [`normal-actor/`](./normal-actor) — Runs as a regular one-shot Actor. Reads `firstNumber` and `secondNumber` (and an optional `waitSeconds`) from input, pushes `{ firstNumber, secondNumber, sum }` to the default dataset, and exits.

Both Actors share the same source code; the runtime mode is selected by `usesStandbyMode` in each Actor's `.actor/actor.json`.

## Getting started

Run a specific Actor locally:

```bash
cd mcp-server-actor   # or: cd normal-actor
apify run
```

Deploy a specific Actor:

```bash
cd mcp-server-actor   # or: cd normal-actor
apify push
```
